        The iPod is a line of portable media players and multi-purpose mobile
        devices[2] designed and marketed by Apple Inc. The first version was
        released on October 23, 2001, about 8+1‚ÅÑ2 months after the Macintosh
        version of iTunes was released. As of May 28, 2019, only the iPod Touch
        (7th generation) remains in production.[3] Like other digital music
        players, some versions of the iPod can serve as external data storage
        devices. Prior to macOS 10.15, Apple's iTunes software (and other
        alternative software) could be used to transfer music, photos, videos,
        games, contact information, e-mail settings, Web bookmarks, and
        calendars to the devices supporting these features from computers using
        certain versions of Apple macOS and Microsoft Windows operating
        systems.[4][5] Before the release of iOS 5, the iPod branding was used
        for the media player included with the iPhone and iPad, a combination of
        the Music and Videos apps on the iPod Touch. As of iOS 5, separate apps
        named "Music" and "Videos" are standardized across all iOS-powered
        products.[6] While the iPhone and iPad have essentially the same media
        player capabilities as the iPod line, they are generally treated as
        separate products. During the middle of 2010, iPhone sales overtook
        those of the iPod.[7]
